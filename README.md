# smart-home
collection of smart home hacks as a means to give back to the awesome optolink-splitter community

These files contain my existing findings related to the undocumented Vitotronic 200 (KW2) addresses needed to read from my oil heating system.
Down the road, I plan to contribute also to making the optolink-splitter more accessible to openHAB users.
